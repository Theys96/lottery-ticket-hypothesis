# lottery-ticket-hypothesis
Experimentation setup for the "Lottery Ticket" hypothesis for neural networks.

---

The lottery ticket hypothesis refers to an idea relating to neural network pruning, first proposed by Frankle and Carbin in 2019 (J. Frankle and M. Carbin. The lottery ticket hypothesis: Training pruned neural networks. CoRR, abs/1803.03635, 2018. URL [http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635](http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635). Accessed: February 2020.). With the code in this repository, we experimented on this hypothesis with a LeNet model on the MNIST dataset.
